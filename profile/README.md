## 🛠️ **What We’re Building**
Wirely is an advanced initiative pushing the boundaries of 3D printing and intelligent systems. Our work is organized into several repositories, each dedicated to a specific part of the project:

- **💡 Thermoforming Circuit Boards (TCBs)**: 
  - Thermoformed Circuit Boards (TCBs) leverage 3D printing to produce custom-shaped, conductive circuit boards using accessible FDM printers, offering enhanced design freedom compared to traditional methods.
  - Our workflow streamlines the process from 2D design to fully functional TCBs, enabling rapid prototyping and integration of electronics into complex shapes tailored for various applications.

- **🤖 Defect Detection**:
  - Our custom-designed Convolutional Neural Network analyzes live camera feed during 3D printing, achieving 96% average accuracy in detecting defects and automatically halting the printer if the defect probability exceeds 80% in the last 5 predictions.
  - This feature minimizes material waste, improves production efficiency, and eliminates the need for constant manual supervision, saving time and ensuring reliability.

- **⚙️ Automatic Correction**:
  - Our system employs a multi-head neural network trained on a comprehensive dataset of over 1.2 million images to enable real-time error detection and correction during 3D printing across diverse geometries, materials, and printing methods, achieving an accuracy of 82%.
  - By analyzing prediction sequences and applying proportional corrections using mode thresholds and interpolation scaling, the system ensures precise adjustments to key parameters like flow rate, lateral speed, Z offset, and hotend temperature, optimizing print quality and reducing failure rates.

- **🌐 Digital Twin**:
  - Our real-time digital twin replicates the 3D printer's movements with zero delay, utilizing G-code parsing and dynamic equations to accurately simulate all XYZ movements, state metrics, and operational parameters.
  - This Industry 4.0-enabled system ensures seamless two-way communication, real-time visualization of key metrics such as temperature, offset, and flow rate, and is perfectly suited for print farms to monitor and manage multiple printers efficiently.
